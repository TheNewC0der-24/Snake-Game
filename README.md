## ABOUT
Yes, I know we all have played the Snake Game and definitely, we never wanted to lose. As kids, we all loved looking for cheats in order to never see the “Game Over” message. 

I create this game using a Python Library i.e., is pygame. 
You can install this library using 'pip install pygame' from your cmd or terminal.

## HOW TO MAKE THIS GAME ?
  1. Installing Pygame
  2. Create the Screen
  3. Create the Snake
  4. Moving the Snake
  5. Game Over when Snake hits the boundaries
  6. Adding the Food
  7. Increasing the Length of the Snake
  8. Displaying the Score
  
## HOW TO PLAY ?
  1. Press `Spacebar` to Start the Game.
  2. Game Window open; <br>
     Then to move snake use up arrow key to move your snake upwards, down arrow key to move your snake downwards, from left arrow key to move your snake leftwards and from right arrow key move you snake towards right.
  3. On Game's Window you we see your current score and High score.
  4. Play your Snake Game and if snake touches the screen or snake ate his tail then "GAME OVER" window pop up's .
  5. To play the game again press Enter.
  6. In this game, there is a cheat button also i.e., 'q'. <br>
     When you press 'q' your current score will be increased.
